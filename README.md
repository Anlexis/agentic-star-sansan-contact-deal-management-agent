# Sansan Contact & Deal Management Agent

AI agent for managing business contacts and deals in Sansan, built with Agentic Star.

> **Category**: Cat 2 (a fixed multi-step pipeline for one job-to-be-done)
> **Industry**: Common
> **Template ID**: CMN-C2-274

## Overview

Turns a plain-language instruction into a single, confirmed action against a Sansan
business-card contact or sales-deal record.

Give it a sentence like *"look up the contact with contact id sc-1001 and summarize the
record"* and it works out which operation you meant, resolves the target record id from the
wording or from the caller-supplied hint, assembles the matching Sansan REST API request, and
hands back a confirmation carrying the affected record id and a `sansan://` reference.

Six intents are supported — look up, create, and update, each against the contact or the deal
collection. Create and update write to the CRM, so the agent never invents a target: a lookup
or update with no explicit record id fails with a clear error rather than touching whatever a
guess would have landed on, and an unclassifiable request falls back to the read-only lookup,
never to a write.

Intent classification and field extraction each have a deterministic baseline (keyword and
pattern based), so the pipeline runs and is testable without a language model — every unit
test still exercises that baseline with no key configured. An optional per-invocation Azure
OpenAI call enhances both steps when the three `AZURE_OPENAI_*` secrets are provisioned; any
failure there (missing secret, API error, malformed response) degrades silently back to the
deterministic result. The record id a write targets is never resolved via the LLM, in either
step — always from the wording or the caller-supplied hint only. Out of the box it ships with a
network-free stub transport that returns the documented Sansan response shapes, which makes
the template runnable end-to-end before you connect a real tenant; injecting a live HTTP
transport and providing an API key is all that is needed to go live.

This is an agent template built with the **AGENTIC STAR** development platform and the
**AgentCore Framework**. It is intended to be taken as a starting point: fork it, adapt it to
your own data and policies, and run it inside your own AGENTIC STAR deployment.

## Requirements

**This template does not run standalone.** It requires:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **AGENTIC STAR platform** | The agent connects to the platform at start-up. Without it, start-up fails immediately (see *Behaviour without the platform* below). Deployment guides and API documentation: [AGENTIC STAR Developers](https://developers.fd.agenticstar.tm.softbank.jp/) |
| **AgentCore Framework** (`agenticstar-agentcore`) | Installed from PyPI as a dependency. |
| Python | >=3.11 |

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Behaviour without the platform

The framework is designed to run **only** on AGENTIC STAR. There is no fallback or degraded
mode. The agent imports its base classes from the framework package at start-up, so without that
package installed and configured, import and graph compile fail outright rather than leaving the
agent running in a partially working state. This is intentional — a half-running agent is worse
than one that refuses to start.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests run without a platform connection. Running the agent itself does not.

## Project Structure

```
src/          agent implementation (nodes, services, schemas)
tests/        unit, integration and boundary tests
config/       agent configuration
docs/         design and operational documentation
```

See `docs/` for the design document and the test specification.

## Customising

1. Adjust `config/` for your own environment and policies.
2. Point the Sansan settings in `config/config.yaml` at your own tenant endpoint.
3. Review the node implementations under `src/nodes/` for domain-specific logic.
4. Re-run the test suite.
