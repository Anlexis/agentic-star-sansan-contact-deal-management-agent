"""Input sanitizing helpers for CMN-C2-274.

Pure, stateless domain helpers (NOT framework gate methods), shared by the
outer backbone pre_process and the inner validate step so that BOTH caller
channels get the same treatment.

That sharing is the point. The framework's own input scan covers the
instruction text but not the structured caller channel, so a screen wired only
into the instruction path would leave caller-supplied text unscreened.

# ── Template-owned instruction-override screen ────────────────────────────────
# Request text is this agent's PRODUCT: callers legitimately write "please
# ignore my previous request", "override approved by the account owner",
# "acting as the deal owner this quarter" — ordinary CRM prose is full of
# directive verbs. A substring screen would refuse real work, so every
# alternative here is anchored on a full directive PHRASE aimed at the MODEL
# (the override verb plus a prompt/instruction noun, or a model role), or on a
# chat-template control token, which has no legitimate reading in a contact or
# deal request.
#
# This screen is the template's own guarantee, not the framework's: the
# platform input gate exists only on 1.0.1+ hosts, covers only
# user_input/validated_input (never the structured caller channel), and
# rejects only HIGH-confidence findings — wherever it is absent the template
